## Installation tool

Shlink provides a helper CLI installation tool which comes in handy to configure your instance when you are not using Shlink's docker image, and you prefer not to use [environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables).

The tool is executed using the `vendor/bin/shlink-installer` script, and it provides a couple of commands that simplify installing/updating shlink instances, or editing some configuration options.

<Callout type="warning">
  The installation tool expects to be executed on Shlink's root directory. Running it at a different level will result in an error.
</Callout>

### Commands

In order to list all available commands from the installation tool, just run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer` with no arguments:

```
Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:
  -h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi|--no-ansi  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
  completion  Dump the shell completion script
  help        Display help for a command
  init        Initializes external dependencies required for Shlink to properly work, like DB, cache warmup, initial GeoLite DB download, etc
  install     Guides you through the installation process, to get Shlink up and running.
  list        List commands
  set-option  Allows you to set new values for any config option.
  update      Helps you import Shlink's config from an older version to a new one.
```

### Main commands

The installation tool is designed to make a couple of main actions: install Shlink, update an existing instance or update the value from a particular config option.

#### Install

In order to install Shlink, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer install`.

It will trigger an interactive tool that will guide you through the installation process, asking you questions about all the aspects in Shlink that can be customized.

```
Welcome to Shlink!!
This tool will guide you through the installation process.

DATABASE
========

Select database type [MySQL]:
 [0] MySQL
 [1] MariaDB
 [2] PostgreSQL
 [3] MicrosoftSQL
 [4] SQLite
>

[...]
```

At the end, it will generate a special config file which will later be consumed by Shlink.

#### Update

In order to update Shlink, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer update`.

The update process is very similar to the "install" one, with the only difference that it will give you the opportunity to consume the config previously generated.

Thanks to that, the update tool will make sure to skip all "questions" for which it can already infer an answer from the previous config.

```
Welcome to Shlink!!
This tool will guide you through the installation process.

Do you want to import configuration from previous installation? (You will still be asked for any new config option that did not exist in previous shlink versions) (yes/no) [yes]:
> yes

Previous shlink installation path from which to import config:
>

[...]
```

Similarly to what the "install" command did, you will end up with a newly generated config file that containing what was firt imported, plus everything you provided for the new questions.

#### Set option

Sometimes you need to change some specific config option, but you don't want to reinstall Shlink completely.

Maybe the database password changed, maybe you want to change your default domain, or maybe you want to disable some tracking option.

In order to be able to do this, run `vendor/bin/shlink-installer set-option`.

It will display a list of all the possible options to customize, and you just have to select one and provide the new value.

```
What config option do you want to change:
 [1 ] Database > Name
 [2 ] Database > Host (or unix socket for PostgreSQL)
 [3 ] Database > Port
 [4 ] Database > User
 [5 ] Database > Password
 [...]
 [14] GeoLite2 license key
 [...]
 [20] Tracking > Disable tracking
 [21] Tracking > Disable IP address tracking
 [...]
 [28] QR codes > Default size
 [29] QR codes > Default margin
 [...]
```

> This command has a limitation. It can only be executed on a Shlink install where the `install` command has been successfully executed first.

#### Init

This command helps to automate Shlink installation, by "initializing" all the external dependencies it needs, like the database, cache warmup, download GeoLite db, etc.

It can be used both for new Shlink installations, but also to update the external environment on a Shlink instance which is being updated, as it also runs database migrations.

This command is internally used both by `install` and `update` commands, but comes in handy in case you want to provide Shlink config via [environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables/).

The official [docker image](/documentation/install-docker-image/) entry point also uses this command, but you don't need to worry in that case.

It allows a bit of customization via CLI flags, depending on your needs:

```
Description:
  Initializes external dependencies required for Shlink to properly work, like DB, cache warmup, initial GeoLite DB download, etc

Usage:
  init [options]

Options:
      --skip-initialize-db     Skip the initial empty database creation. It will make this command fail on a later stage if the database was not created manually.
      --clear-db-cache         Clear the database metadata cache.
      --initial-api-key        Create and print initial admin API key.
      --download-rr-binary     Download a RoadRunner binary. Useful only if you plan to serve Shlink with Roadrunner.
      --skip-download-geolite  Skip downloading the initial GeoLite DB file. Shlink will try to download it the first time it needs to geolocate visits.
```

* `--skip-initialize-db`: it can be passed when updating Shlink to skip a command which won't have any effect anyway.
* `--clear-db-cache`: you want to provide this every time you update Shlink, but passing it on new installations won't have any side effect.
* `--initial-api-key`: useful for new Shlink instances, so that it generates a first admin API key.
* `--download-rr-binary`: If you are serving/want to [serve Shlink with RoadRunner](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner), this option will ensure the binary is downloaded.
* `--skip-download-geolite`: If you are not passing a [GeoLite license key](/documentation/geolite-license-key/), you can pass this to skip a command which won't have any effect anyway.

> This command is available since Shlink 3.6.0
