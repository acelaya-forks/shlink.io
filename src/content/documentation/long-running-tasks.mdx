## Long-running tasks

There are a few tasks Shlink needs to perform which are too heavy or time-consuming to be executed when a user visits a short URL.

In order to redirect end users as fast as possible to the final URLs, these tasks have been left for you to configure when and how often should they be executed.

### Locate visits

Shlink provides the command `visit:locate` which will process all the IP addresses from visits in order to locate them.

You can of course run it manually from time to time, but it is a good idea to schedule its execution.

> Shlink locates visits automatically just after redirecting end users. However, it might be a good idea to have previous scheduling in place, as a backup in case it fails.
>
> When using the docker image, you can either configure this scheduling externally, or, if using Shlink v2.8.0 or newer, provide `-e ENABLE_PERIODIC_VISIT_LOCATE=true` in order to schedule visits to be located very hour inside the container itself.

---

> One way to schedule any of the previous tasks is by making use of Unix cron jobs:
>
> For example, this cron will locate visits every hour. The `-q` flag is available on any Shlink command and will discard any output generated from it.
>
> `0 * * * * /path/to/shlink/bin/cli visit:locate -q`
