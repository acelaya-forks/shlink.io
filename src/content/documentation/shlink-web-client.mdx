## Shlink web client

Shlink web client (aka `shlink-web-client`) is the official Progressive Web Application for Shlink.

It provides a beautiful UI from which you can handle your short URLs, create new ones or see very detailed and customizable visits stats.

It is part of the same organization and usually supports all Shlink features, soon after they are released.
