## Supported runtimes

Shlink supports a number of ways to serve it. Each one of them has pros and cons, and depending on your technical knowledge and needs, you may prefer to choose one or another.

This document offers a comparison of all of them, to help you make the best decision.

#### Openswoole

[Openswoole](https://openswoole.com/) is a native PHP extension, that needs to installed with [pecl](https://pecl.php.net/).

It lets you load Shlink in memory, and serve requests without reloading the service, which makes it very fast.

It also supports running heavy tasks in background (like updating the [GeoLite2](/documentation/geolite-license-key/) database file or notifying [real-time updates](/documentation/advanced/real-time-updates/)).

This makes it the current **officially recommended runtime**.

Follow [the documentation](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-openswoole) in order to get it installed.

#### RoadRunner

In essence, [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/) is very similar to openswoole, with the difference that the server is written in go, and you can install it directly with Shlink (no need to handle PHP extensions).

It provides the same capabilities as openswoole, and is almost as performant, while much easier to install.

Follow [the documentation](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner) in order to know how to get it up and running.

<Callout type="warning">
  RoadRunner support was added in Shlink 3.3.0, and is currently experimental, but it is very promising and can soon become the officially recommended runtime.
</Callout>

#### Classic web server

This is the way traditionally PHP apps have been served.

It requires a web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) and a FastCGI, like [php-fpm](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php).

It is the least performant option, as Shlink needs to be bootstrapped on every request, but at the same time it is the more predictable option and the one you may prefer if you have experience hosting other PHP apps.

Follow [the documentation](/documentation/supported-runtimes/classic-web-server) in order to know how to get it working.
