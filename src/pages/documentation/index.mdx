## Getting started

Shlink is a self-hosted URL shortener which provides both a [REST](/documentation/api-docs) and a [CLI](/documentation/command-line-interface/entry-point) interface to interact with it.

Additionally, there's also an official [Shlink web client](/documentation/shlink-web-client) which, by making use of Shlink's REST API, provides a beautiful web UI to handle multiple Shlink instances.

This documentation will walk you through the process of getting both Shlink and shlink-web-client installed, using one of the many available approaches.

You will also learn how it is architected, how to use it once installed, and answers to frequently asked questions.
