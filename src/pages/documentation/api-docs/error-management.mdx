## Error management

Shlink's REST API implements the [Problem Details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) standard for error management.

Because of this, all error responses will have `Content-Type: application/problem+json`, and the payload will have at least these properties:

* `type`: A unique error code identifying the error.
* `detail`: A human-friendly description of the error.
* `title`: A short unique error title.
* `status`: The same value returned as the response status code.

```json
{
  "type": "TAG_NOT_FOUND",
  "detail": "Tag with name \"foo\" could not be found",
  "title": "Tag not found",
  "status": 404
}
```

Some errors can have extra properties, depending on their nature.

```json
{
  "type": "INVALID_SLUG",
  "detail": "Provided slug \"custom\" is already in use",
  "title": "Invalid custom slug",
  "status": 400,
  "customSlug": "custom"
}
```

Error interpretation depends on the context and the endpoint. Every endpoint includes the documentation for its specific errors.

For more information, read the [API specification](https://api-spec.shlink.io).
