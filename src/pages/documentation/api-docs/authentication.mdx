## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. In order to do it, always provide a `X-Api-Key: {api_key}` header on every request.

### Managing API keys

API keys are generated (and managed) from the command line. Run the `api-key:generate` command to get a new and valid API key.

```shell
shlink api-key:generate --name=my_api_key
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Starting with Shlink v4.3, API keys are hashed before being persisted, so it's very important you save them once generated, as you won't be able to get the value afterwards.

  Providing the name is also a good idea to uniquely identify generated API keys afterwards.
</Callout>

This command optionally accepts an expiration date through the `--expiration-date`|`-e` modifier:

```shell
shlink api-key:generate --expiration-date 2020-01-01
```

Disabling existing API keys is also possible, through the `api-key:disable` command:

```shell
shlink api-key:disable my_api_key --by-name

# Disabling via the plain-text key is possible but deprecated
shlink api-key:disable 1ae89449-f8d2-4b44-baf7-dd7eb0b05017
```

You can also rename an existing API key, but remember names have to be unique.

```shell
shlink api-key:rename my_api_key the_key_for_my_client
```

### Listing API keys

You can see all existing APi keys by running `shlink api-key:list`.

The output will allow you to see which API keys are expired or disabled, and what are their names.

```shell
shlink api-key:list

+--------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-------+
| Name                                 | Is enabled | Expiration date           | Roles |
+--------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-------+
| Disabled                             | ---        | -                         | Admin |
+--------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-------+
| my_api_key                           | +++        | -                         | Admin |
+--------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-------+
| d438df20-****-****-****-************ | +++        | 2024-12-05T00:00:00+00:00 | Admin |
+--------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-------+
```

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with Shlink v4.3, all API keys that are created without a name will fall back to a redacted version of the key.
</Callout>

### API key roles

Starting with Shlink v2.5.0, API keys can have a set of roles that will limit the operations they can do. <Link href="/documentation/api-docs/api-key-roles/">Read the docs</Link> to learn how.

### Errors during authentication

When performing an API call, if no API key is provided, or it is invalid/disabled/expired, the server will return this response payload, with status 401.

```json
{
  "type": "https://shlink.io/api/error/invalid-api-key",
  "detail": "Provided API key does not exist or is invalid",
  "title": "Invalid API key",
  "status": 401
}
```
