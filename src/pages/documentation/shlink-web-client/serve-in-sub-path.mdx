## Serve in sub path

Official distributable files and docker images have been built so that they are served from the root of a domain.

If you need to host shlink-web-client yourself and serve it from a subpath, follow these steps:

* Download shlink-web-client source code for the version you want to build.
    * For example, if you want to build `v2.3.1`, use this link https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/archive/v2.3.1.zip
    * Replace the `v2.3.1` part in the link with the one of the version you want to build.
* Decompress the file and `cd` into the resulting folder.
* Open the `package.json` file in the root of the project, locate the `homepage` property and replace the value (which should be an empty string) by the path from which you want to serve shlink-web-client.
    * For example: `"homepage": "/my-projects/shlink-web-client"`.
* Build the project:
    * For classic hosting:
        * Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) 16 or later.
        * Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
        * Build the project by running `npm run build`.
        * Once the command finishes, you will have a `build` folder with all the static assets you need to run shlink-web-client. Just place them wherever you want them to be served from.
    * For docker image:
        * Download [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
        * Build the docker image by running `docker build . -t shlink-web-client`.
        * Once the command finishes, you will have an image with the name `shlink-web-client`.
