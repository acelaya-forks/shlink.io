## Serve Shlink using FrankenPHP

Starting with v4.6.0, it is possible to use [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/) to serve Shlink, using its [worker mode](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/worker/).

### Installing FrankenPHP binary

The first thing you need to do is getting the [official binary](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/#standalone-binary):

```shell
curl https://frankenphp.dev/install.sh | sh
mv frankenphp /usr/local/bin/
```

### Running Shlink with FrankenPHP

Now, you can run the following command:

```shell
frankenphp php-server --worker /path/to/shlink/bin/frankenphp-worker.php
```

Where `/path/to/shlink` is the directory where you downloaded Shlink. The `frankenphp-worker.php` script is provided by Shlink.

FrankenPHP supports many other configuration options. Take a look at [their documentation](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/config/) to customize it for your needs.
