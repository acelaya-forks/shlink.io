## Serve Shlink using openswoole

Shlink can be served using [openswoole](https://openswoole.com/).

It provides a non-blocking I/O server, similar to the one used for node.js applications, which lets web apps to be run once and kept in memory while serving requests.

openswoole is quite fast, and has a few extra benefits (like running some heavy tasks immediately after a request has been served).

<Callout type="info">
  Shlink v3.0.0 officially supports only <b>openswoole</b>, and no longer regular <b>swoole</b>. However, the functionality does not currently deviate too much, so regular swoole will continue to be detected as openswoole for the time being.

  If for any reason regular swoole stops working, the only officially supported solution will be to migrate to openswoole.
</Callout>

In order to use openswoole, you have to install the openswoole PHP extension using Pecl: `pecl install openswoole-22.0.0`.

After that, you can serve Shlink with `php vendor/bin/laminas mezzio:swoole:start`.

### Shlink as a system service

Since you probably don't want to manually start Shlink every time, this explains how to set it up as a Daemon in Linux.

First you need to create a daemon script, in `/etc/init.d/shlink_swoole`.

You can use this sample, replacing `/path/to/shlink` by the path to your shlink installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          shlink_openswoole
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $network $named $time $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $network $named $time $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Description:       Shlink non-blocking server with openswoole
### END INIT INFO

SCRIPT=/path/to/shlink/vendor/bin/laminas\ mezzio:swoole:start
RUNAS=root

PIDFILE=/var/run/shlink_openswoole.pid
LOGDIR=/var/log/shlink
LOGFILE=${LOGDIR}/shlink_openswoole.log

start() {
  if [[ -f "$PIDFILE" ]] && kill -0 $(cat "$PIDFILE"); then
    echo 'Shlink with openswoole already running' >&2
    return 1
  fi
  echo 'Starting shlink with openswoole' >&2
  mkdir -p "$LOGDIR"
  touch "$LOGFILE"
  local CMD="$SCRIPT &> \"$LOGFILE\" & echo \$!"
  su -c "$CMD" $RUNAS > "$PIDFILE"
  echo 'Shlink started' >&2
}

stop() {
  if [[ ! -f "$PIDFILE" ]] || ! kill -0 $(cat "$PIDFILE"); then
    echo 'Shlink with openswoole not running' >&2
    return 1
  fi
  echo 'Stopping shlink with openswoole' >&2
  kill -15 $(cat "$PIDFILE") && rm -f "$PIDFILE"
  echo 'Shlink stopped' >&2
}

case "$1" in
  start)
    start
    ;;
  stop)
    stop
    ;;
  restart)
    stop
    start
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
esac
```

Then run these commands to enable the service and start it:

* `sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/shlink_swoole`
* `sudo update-rc.d shlink_swoole defaults`
* `sudo update-rc.d shlink_swoole enable`
* `/etc/init.d/shlink_swoole start`

After that, you should be able to access shlink on port 8080. The service will be automatically run at system start-up, and all access logs will be written in `/var/log/shlink/shlink_swoole.log`.

### Exposing Shlink through a reverse proxy

Event though previous steps are enough to make Shlink usable, there are still a couple of missing things to make it production-ready.

Follow [the instructions](/documentation/advanced/exposing-through-reverse-proxy) to configure a reverse proxy in front of Shlink.
