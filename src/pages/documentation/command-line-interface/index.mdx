## Command Line Interface

Due to the project's architecture, and the lack of an integrated GUI, Shlink provides a couple of command line tools that can be used to install or update Shlink instances, or even completely manage Shlink as a whole (create short URLs, see visits, manage domains, etc).

Take a look to a more in-depth documentation for each command line tool:
