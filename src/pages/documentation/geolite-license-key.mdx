## GeoLite2 license key

Shlink makes use of a [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database, by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com), to geolocate visits to your short URLs.

To make sure the data is always up-to-date, it downloads new versions of the database regularly.

However, in order to do this, Shlink needs a GeoLite2 license key. These licenses are free, and you can easily generate one by following the instructions below.

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't provide a GeoLite2 license key, Shlink will simply not geolocate visits.
</Callout>

### Generate a license key

In order to generate the license key, follow these steps.

* Create a MaxMind [account for GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).
* Generate a [license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key). Its **important** that you save the value, as you will not be able to recover it afterwards.

### Provide the license key to Shlink

Once you have your license key, you will need to provide it to Shlink.

* Via environment variable: use `GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY` to set your license key.
* Via [installation tool](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool): you will be asked to provide the license key when installing or updating Shlink, or you can use [set-option](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool#set-option) to set it later.
