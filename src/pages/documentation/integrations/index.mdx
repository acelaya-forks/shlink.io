## Integrations

Since Shlink exposes a REST API, it is possible to use it and integrate it with third party services.

Here you will find official documentation on how to integrate Shlink with some popular apps.

> If you are already using Shlink with some service or app that's not listed here, feel free to [let me know](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink.io/issues/new), and I will add it.
