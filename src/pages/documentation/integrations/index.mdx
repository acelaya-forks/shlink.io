## Integrations

Since Shlink exposes a REST API, it is possible to use it to integrate it with third party services.

Here you will find links to official SDKs, official documentation on how to integrate Shlink with some popular apps and links for third party integrations developed by users and Shlink fans.

> If you are already using Shlink with some service or app that's not listed here, feel free to [let me know](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink.io/issues/new), and I will add it.
