## GNOME Shell extension

You can install the GNOME extension for Shlink from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3282/shlink-url-shortener/)
or any Software Center application that supports installing GNOME Shell extensions.

Usage is pretty straightforward: Once you've set up your Shlink instance URL and API key in the extension settings,
you can copy a URL and press `Ctrl+Super+Q` (or your custom keyboard shortcut) to shorten the URL in clipboard.
Your desktop will show a notification on success or error.
