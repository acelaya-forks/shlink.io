## Short Menu for iOS

You can download **Short Menu for iOS** from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/short-menu/id885851937).

It supports several SaaS URL shorteners out of the box, but you can also configure custom services.

In order to integrate your Shlink instance with it, open Short Menu, and go to **Settings**, by clicking on the "gear" icon, on the top-right corner of the app.

Once there, you have to select **Custom Services**.

Tap on the **+** button, on the top-right corner, in order to configure a new custom service.

Once there, you have two options:

* Use the regular `POST` endpoint, which supports providing all the configuration options listed in the [API spec](https://api-spec.shlink.io/#/Short%20URLs/createShortUrl).

* Use the `GET` endpoint, where the only thing that can be provided is the long URL.

Regardless the option you choose, you need to replace `{DOMAIN}` with the domain in which you are exposing your Shlink instance, and `{API_KEY}`, with your own API key.

Once finished, tap on **Done**, on the top-right corner.
