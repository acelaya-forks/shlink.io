## Send visits to Matomo

Starting with v3.7.0, Shlink can send every visit to a [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) instance of your choice.

Matomo is an open source Google Analytics alternative, which can be self-hosted or used in the cloud, with a philosophy very much in line with Shlink's.

Sending visits to Matomo will enable an alternative UI to check short URL visits, and take advantage of all its analytics capabilities.

### Matomo integration FAQ

This is some general information and considerations when integrating Shlink with a Matomo instance:

* When enabled, all visits are sent to Matomo, no matter the runtime used to serve Shlink. When using a runtime that supports background jobs (like [roadrunner](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner)), it will send the visits asynchronously, with no impact to end visitors. However, if you serve Shlink with a [classic web server](/documentation/supported-runtimes/classic-web-server), visits will be sent to matomo before redirecting the visitor to the long URL.
* In order to integrate a matomo instance, you need to provide three configuration options:
  * An instance public URL that can be reached by Shlink.
  * The Site ID (usually a number). You can see how to get this value in [their docs](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_19212/).
  * An API token. Their docs explain how to [generate one](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_114/).
* While Matomo supports sending data via `GET` and `POST`, Shlink will always use the latter, making sure data is secure as long as your Matomo instance uses HTTPS.
* Matomo [tracks unique visits](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_36/) in intervals of 30 minutes. Any new visit from the [same visitor](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_43) within this interval will be tracked as an action of the same visit. This could make visits tracked by Shlink and Matomo differ.
* Shlink will send raw IP addresses to Matomo, to let it [geolocate](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/setting-up-accurate-visitors-geolocation/) them in case something failed in Shlink side. Matomo has [its own mechanism](https://matomo.org/faq/general/configure-privacy-settings-in-matomo/) to anonymize visitor's IP addresses.

### Configuring Matomo integration

As with any other configuration params, there are two main ways to provide matomo integration options:

* [Environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables/#matomo-integration), which allow you to enable the integration however you like.
* The [installation tool](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool/), which, at some point in the process, will ask you if you want to integrate with matomo, and request you to provide all required options.
