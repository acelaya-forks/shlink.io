## Dynamic rule-based redirects system

Shlink 4.0.0 introduced a new system to dynamically redirect visitors to different long URLs based on runtime conditions.

It works by allowing you to define any number of rules for a short URL, which are checked sequentially based on their priority, until one matches.

If a rule matches, the visitor is redirected to that rule's long URL, and only if none match, they are redirected to the default long URL normally.

Every rule can be composed of any number of conditions, but all of them need to match in order to consider the rule a positive match.

### Supported conditions

Currently, Shlink supports the next condition types:

* **Language**: Checks the `Accept-Language` header in order to see if one specific language is accepted.
* **Query param**: Verifies if the query string contains a specific query param with a specific value.
* **Device**: Tries to match the visitor's device based on the `User-Agent` header, and infer if it's `Android`, `iOS` or `Desktop`. Other devices like `Tablet`, `iPad` etc. could be added in the future.

  Device rules used to be handled separately, but they were migrated to the new rule system for consistency and flexibility.

### Handling redirect rules

There are mainly two ways to manage dynamic redirect rules for a specific short URL:

* The REST API, via [POST /short-urls/[shortCode]/redirect-rules](https://api-spec.shlink.io/?version=v4.0.0#/Redirect%20rules/setShortUrlRedirectRules) endpoint, which expects a body like this:
  ```json
  {
    "redirectRules": [
      {
        "longUrl": "https://example.com/android-en-us",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "type": "device",
            "matchValue": "android",
            "matchKey": null
          },
          {
            "type": "language",
            "matchValue": "en-US",
            "matchKey": null
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "longUrl": "https://example.com/fr",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "type": "language",
            "matchValue": "fr",
            "matchKey": null
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "longUrl": "https://example.com/query-foo-bar-hello-world",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "type": "query",
            "matchKey": "foo",
            "matchValue": "bar"
          },
          {
            "type": "query",
            "matchKey": "hello",
            "matchValue": "world"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
* The command line interface, via `short-code:manage-rules` command:
  ```shell
  $ shlink short-url:manage-rules rmD8f
   ---------- ------------------- -----------------------------
    Priority   Conditions          Redirect to
   ---------- ------------------- -----------------------------
    1          device is android   https://example.com/android
    2          device is desktop   https://example.com
   ---------- ------------------- -----------------------------

### FAQs

* **Can I use the same type of condition more than once in the same rule?**

  Yes. Of course, this does not always make sense, like a visitor will never be using an `Android` and `iOS` device at the same time, but you could check for more than one query param, or if more than one language is accepted.

* **Can I make a rule match as soon as some of its conditions match?**

  No. In order to match a rule, all its conditions need to positively match. There's no way to configure a partial match.

  However, this behavior can be easily mimicked by defining consecutive rules that redirect to the same long URL.

  For example, if you want to redirect to `https://example.com/foo` when visitors are (`Android` AND `?foo=bar`) OR (`iOS` AND `?hello=world`), create one rule for the first two conditions, and another rule for the other two, and point both of them to `https://example.com/foo`.

* **How granular is the language condition?**

  The Language condition allows for a lot of flexibility, as you can match full locales (in the form of `en_US` or `en-US`) but also language codes.

  For example, if you define the rule with value `es-ES` and the header is sent like `Accept-Language: fr-FR, es-ES, en-UK`, it will match positively, however, it won't match `Accept-Language: es`.

  On the other hand, if the rule is defined as only `es`, it will match in both cases, as it means "any Spanish".

  There's one exception. If the `Accept-Language` header is sent with value `*`, it will be ignored and never match, as it would incorrectly match any language otherwise.

  Finally, it's worth mentioning language matches are case-insensitive.
