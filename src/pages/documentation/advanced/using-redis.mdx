## Using redis

Shlink can take advantage of [redis](https://redis.io/) in multiple contexts.

* For [caching purposes](/documentation/advanced/using-redis/#caching-purposes).
* To store [shared locks](/documentation/advanced/using-redis/#shared-locks).
* To publish [real-time updates](/documentation/advanced/real-time-updates/#redis-pub-sub) via Pub/Sub.

#### Caching purposes

Shlink can persist certain things in a faster storage for quick access.

By default, it uses APCu if available (when using a [classic web server](/documentation/supported-runtimes/classic-web-server/)) or in-memory (when using [Roadrunner](/documentation/supported-runtimes/serve-with-roadrunner/) as the runtimes), but it can be provided with some redis access configuration.

When doing so, Shlink will use redis as the cache persistence.

#### Shared locks

<Callout type="info">
  **Locks** are used to make sure certain tasks are not run more than once in parallel. For example, geolocating visits.
</Callout>

If you plan to run multiple Shlink instances, it's important to make sure the so-called "locks" are shared between all of them.

Redis is a good way to do so. If Shlink is provided with redis access configuration, it will use it to store shared locks.

### Supported capabilities

Shlink supports multiple redis capabilities. They can be enabled by providing different connection URIs:

* [Redis instance](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/), when providing just one server (for example, `tcp://my_redis_server:6379`).
* [Redis cluster](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/), when providing multiple servers (for example, `tcp://one_redis_server:6379,tcp://another_redis_server:6379`).
* [Redis sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel/), when providing multiple servers, together with a sentinel service name.
* Database selection (since Shlink 4.2.1), by providing the database index in the URI path (for example, `tcp://my_redis_server:6379/5`).
* Credentials, that can be provided as part of the server URIs, either both [username and password](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl/) (`tcp://the_username:the_password@my_redis_server:6379`) or [just password](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/) (`tcp://:the_password@my_redis_server:6379`).
  <Callout type="warning">
    Prior to Shlink 3.7.0, password-only URIs had the form `tcp://the_password@my_redis_server:6379`.
    Since that's not a valid URI, it has been removed in Shlink 4.0.0
  </Callout>

### Providing configuration

As with any other configuration params, there are two main ways to provide redis options:

* [Environment variables](/documentation/environment-variables/#redis-integration), which allow you to enable the integration however you like.
* The [installation tool](/documentation/command-line-interface/installation-tool/), which will, at some point, ask you if you want to integrate with redis, and request you to provide all the capabilities above if so.

  INTEGRATIONS
  ============

   Do you want to use a redis instance, redis cluster or redis sentinels as a shared cache for Shlink? (recommended if you run a cluster of Shlink instances) (yes/no) [no]:
   > yes

   Provide a comma-separated list of URIs (redis servers/sentinel instances):
   > tcp://one_redis_server:6379,tcp://another_redis_server:6379

   Provide the name of the sentinel service (leave empty if not using redis sentinel):
   >

   Do you want Shlink to publish real-time updates in this Redis instance/cluster? (yes/no) [no]:
   > yes

   [...]
  ```
